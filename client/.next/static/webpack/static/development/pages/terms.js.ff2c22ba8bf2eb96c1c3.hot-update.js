Provided payment is received within 10 days of the placed candidate\u2019s commencement of employment, Company will offer Customer the following guarantee: \u2022 If the candidate is terminated for substandard work performance or voluntarily resigns within the first 30 calendar days of the candidate\u2019s start date, all monies paid by Customer for the related transaction will be refunded. \u2022 If the candidate is terminated for substandard work performance or voluntarily resigns between 31 and 60 calendar days of the candidate\u2019s start date, two-thirds of all monies paid by Customer for the related transaction collected will be refunded. \u2022 If the candidate is terminated for substandard work performance or voluntarily resigns between 61 and 90 calendar days of the candidate\u2019s start date, one-third of all monies paid by Customer for the related transaction will be refunded. This guarantee does not apply in cases of merger, acquisition or layoff. To qualify for this guarantee, Customer must notify Company within 15 days after the candidate\u2019s last day of work. All referrals will remain in effect for one year. If Customer interviews a candidate from Company and that candidate is hired by Customer anytime over the following year, Company will be entitled to its entire fee regardless of Customer\u2019s evidence of prior or subsequent introductions to the candidate. Customer agrees to pay in full all sums due to Company under this agreement, regardless if Customer redirects or outsources placement services to a third party organization.
