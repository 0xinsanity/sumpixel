To qualify for this guarantee, Customer must notify Company within 15 days after the candidate’s last day of work.\n\nAll referrals will remain in effect for one year. If Customer interviews a candidate from Company and that candidate is hired by Customer anytime over the following year, Company will be entitled to its entire fee regardless of Customer’s evidence of prior or subsequent introductions to the candidate.\n\nCustomer agrees to pay in full all sums due to Company under this agreement, regardless if Customer redirects or outsources placement services to a third party organization. Any additional costs incurred by Customer will be the sole responsibility of Customer.\n</Typography.Text>\n            </Container>\n        </>\n    );\n};\n\nexport default Terms;"],"mappings":";;;;;;;;;;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAIA;AAEA;AAGA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AAAA;AAMA;AAAA;AAgDA;AACA;AACA;;;;A","sourceRoot":""}
